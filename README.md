# PythonTutorials
Learning Python by completing different tutorials on sites like CodingBat

Hopefully, here i can put down all of my Python learning process from the beginning. I will simply be adding files that are
my code, copied and pasted from the sites with the challenges I complete. Further Python projects, that are independent, will be 
stored in new repositories.
